This repo contains a model and code to evaluate the quality of traffic landmarks given a binary mask.
To obtain the binary mask you can use one of the segmentation models found in the traffic landmark segmentation repository.

the model can be found here :

All you need to do is to replace the paths in the notebook and run it.

The output will be an evaluation of the quality of deterioration of the landmarks shown in an image.
